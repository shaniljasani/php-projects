# Frontend - ListInsertionVisualization
This is an interview question I got wrong, but wanted to solve.

I don't remember the exact instructions but here are some requirements

* Languages: HTML, JS, and CSS
* Accept numerical inputs into a text box
* On button action, add to a list
* Every third element will be in RED
